An important distinction between HTML and CSS. HTML markup should provide semantic information about your content—not presentational information. In other words, HTML should define the structure of your document, leaving its appearance to CSS.

be very careful not to abuse the <br/> tag. Each one you use should still convey meaning—you shouldn’t use it to, say, add a bunch of space between paragraphs:

Like <br/>, <hr/> should carry meaning—don’t use it when you just want to display a line for the sake of aesthetics. For that, you’ll want to use the CSS border property

Another way to think about the <hr/> element is that it carries less significance than the separation created by a new heading element, but more significance than a new paragraph.
